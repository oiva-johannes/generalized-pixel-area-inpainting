### Computing the color pixel values for any sized area using matrix math and matlab

This process is known as image inpainting and I will show you how to do it **fast**, intuitively and for **any** sized area.

The problem is as following:

<figure align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/oiva-johannes/generalized-pixel-area-inpainting/assets/72695556/fc1b918c-e4a5-41c5-badc-f799531891af" alt="3x4 area">
  <figcaption>Caption for the image</figcaption>
</figure>

Here we have some sized area (in this case 3x4) with some border values (these are needed)
